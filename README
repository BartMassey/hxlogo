This lump of ill-formed stuff is hxlogo, an implementation of the
ancient and venerable xlogo program via Antoine Latter's
most excellent xhb X Haskell Bindings.

There are many limitations here. A lightly-patched xhb is
(currently) required to build this. I suspect it fails on
big-endian clients, due to another missing xhb patch. No
flags are supported; hxlogo infers whether you have the
Render extension at an appropriate version, and proceeds on
that basis alone. I doubt hxlogo will work without a window
manager running.

The point of this exercise, of course, was not really to
replace xlogo, which is working just fine thank you very
much. It was to evaluate xhb, and the difficulty of building
atop it.
