-- | In X, strings are typically length-list, where the list
-- is an array of Word8. Note that character-width issues are
-- ill-specified and poorly-handled. Anyhow...
-- 
-- This module provides a data structure representing an X
-- string, and a conversion routine for making one out of a
-- Haskell 'String'. This is one of two considered approaches;
-- the other, using a type class, was rejected since doing it
-- this way caches the conversion.
