-- Draw the "official" X Window System Logo, designed by
-- Danny Chong
-- 
-- Written by Ollie Jones, Apollo Computer
-- 
-- Does some fancy stuff to make the logo look acceptable
-- even if it is tiny.  Also makes the various linear
-- elements of the logo line up as well as possible
-- considering rasterization.
-- 
-- Munged to draw anti-aliased logo using Render extension.
-- Carl Worth, 2002-05-16

-- Reimplemented as Haskell. Bart Massey, 2010-11-11
